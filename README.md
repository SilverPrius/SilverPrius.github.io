# Connect Four / Project 1

This game was my first project in my Software Engineering program at Per Scholas. More information about the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four

## Game Functions: 

This is a 2 player turn based game that begins with the red player going first.

When the current player hovers the mouse on a column that has an empty space, the player's color piece will appear above the column. This indicates that the player can drop their piece into that column by clicking the mouse.

If the player's piece is not shown above that column, this indicates that the column is full. They must select a different column.

Once the player drops their piece into an available space, it will be the next player's turn, and the color of the piece will switch between red and yellow.

The first player to connect 4 of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), wins the game! 

If the board is completely filled up without a winner, the game is a draw!

Clicking the Reset button will reload the webpage. This will clear all the pieces from the board, and restart the game.

The 4 winning pieces will turn into squares; so that they can be easily identified.
