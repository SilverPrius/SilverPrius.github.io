#Connect Four / Project 1

This game was my first project in my Software Engineering program at Per Scholas. More information about the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four

Game Functions: 

This is a 2 player turn based game that begins with the red player going first.

When the current player hovers the mouse on a column that has an empty space, the player's piece will appear above the column. This indicates that the player can drop their piece into that column.

Once the player drops their piece into an available space, it will be the next player's turn and the color of the piece will switch between red and yellow.

If a player is able to to connect 4 of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), they win the game! 

If the board is completely filled up without a winner, the game is a draw!

Clicking the Reset button will reload the webpage. This will clear all the pieces from the board and restart the game.

User Stories:

The 4 winning pieces will turn into squares; so that they can be easily identified.
